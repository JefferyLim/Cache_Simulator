I. Introduction
	A. State objective

II. Project Development
	A. Discuss important programming choices?
	B. Anything else pertinent to subject

III. Results
	A. Graphs (and related discussion) of performance for simulation results
		1. Execution Times of production traces for the 9 configurations
		2. CPI of the production traces for the 9 configurations
		5. Cost for all configurations //each traces have same costs
		
		3. mem_chunksize graph of performance vs. cost --> NOTE TO TAY: ADD 8 BYTES TO DATA
			a. at least one paragraph describing best main memory system model
			b. discuss effects of main memory system bandwith on overall system performance
		4. CPI vs. Cost?
		6. VC Hit Counts of all traces & configurations
			a. Figure out and discuss significance
	B. Temporal/Spectral locality? Find and destroy topic

IV. Conclusion
	A. Some stuff about what was learned
